# Cryptocurrencies


Analysis Overview

For this project, we used unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database containing different cryptocurrencies and created a report that included all the different traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.  An investment bank could utilize this report to possibly propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to offer to their clients.  In order to perform this analysis, we preprocessed the database, reduced the data dimmension using Principal Component Analysis, clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-Means, and create visualizations results with 2D and 3D scatter plots. 


Results 

After performing the unsupervised machine learning analysis, we were able to identify the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.  Particularities of each group of cryptocurrencies need to be analyzed in order to determine their performance and potential interest for investment banks when offering investment portfolios to their clients.
